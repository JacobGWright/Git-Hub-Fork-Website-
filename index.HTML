                <p class="p-3">
                    Technical Writing is any writing that occurs in a professional setting. It is both an art and a science, relevant to any field, that develops the best methods of delivering information. It is important, especially in today's environment of mass communication, that workplace writing is done to a high standard that implements the following characteristics:
                <ul>
                    <li>Accuracy</li>
                    <li>Clarity</li>
                    <li>Conciseness</li>
                    <li>Readability/Usability</li>
                    <li>Correctness</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p class="p-3">
                    Successful technical writing will result in an informative document that guides any reader to the correct conclusions. The document must be designed and written in a way that captivates its audience, otherwise the reader may disregard most, if not all, of the contained information.
                </p>
                <p class="p-3">
                    It is clear to see that technical writing includes not only writing proposals and memorandums, but also extends to a wider range of communication. This includes writing code, and designing infographics.

            <h3 class=" font-weight-bold department-h2 text-center orangeTitlenoBorder mt-3">NGCMP 0401 Written Professional Communication: Topics in Diversity</h3>
            <div class="font-weight-bold computerText container">This course explores the methods of inquiry, analysis and composition characteristic of written communication in professional settings.  The course will examine such writing's specialized use of language, conventions and formats, premises, motives, and purposes.  By preparing letters, resumes, proposals, reports, etc., students will get a feel not only for what "professional" communication is, but also for how and why it does, or can, or should function. This Topics in Diversity section of WPC will invite students to expand and complicate their understanding of the benefits of workplace diversity and of the problems arising from the unequal distribution of power and privilege across positions (including race, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, ability, religion, and class) in the professions. Students will explore the dynamics of power and hierarchy in their chosen field as they observe daily operations and interactions during worksite field visits, and they will consider how these dynamics perpetuate or diminish inequities and marginalization. Among the topics considered are discrimination in hiring and on the job in terms of employment training, responsibilities, pay, and promotions.  Students gain practice articulating their individual diversity as job candidates in resumes and cover letters, and in composing professional documents that address a complaint, seek a remedy, and establish new policies to address hypothetical discriminatory issues that they may experience in the future.</div>

            <div class="font-weight-bold computerText container">How have computational devices affected the way we think about our own humanity? This course prepares students to critically examine the intersections between digital devices and human life. Covering topics such as the relationship between computers and humans, surveillance, big data, and interactivity and games, we question what it means to be human in a space of pervasive digitality. Assessment will be based on regular online posts, midterm examination, a final curation project, and class participation, both digital and face-to-face. The course fills the Philosophy General Education requirement and meets three times per week: twice for lecture, once for recitation/lab. </div>

            <div class="font-weight-bold computerText container">This course allows students to explore the rhetorical implications of design and invites students to consider design and writing as an integrated process. The class will alternate lecture/discussion sessions with studio sessions, so that students can learn how to use Adobe InDesign to create both single- and multi-paged documents for particular rhetorical contexts. Students will also learn how to manipulate images in Adobe Photoshop so that they will better serve their purposes. Our classes will focus on theory of writing and design, critique and analysis of documents that students create, and critique and analysis of documents created by professionals. Students will write and design a resume and cover letter; write analyses of professional examples they find especially problematic or compelling; create brief, fully designed argument pieces conceptualized in two different ways; create a poster; replicate and revise existing professionally produced examples; and propose, write, and design a multi-paged designed document to accomplish a specific outcome for a particular audience. This class assumes that students are comfortable with using a computer and with learning new software. The course is offered during Spring term and Summer session 1.</div>

            <div class="font-weight-bold computerText container">This course is designed to allow students to engage with data in their writing and learn how to effectively write with numbers. Students will work with a dataset of their choosing and develop several pieces reliant on quantification for both lay and specialized audiences. Through these writing projects and classroom activities, students will learn about how to find data for their writing, how to plan effective utilization of this data in a broader argument, how to responsibly and effectively use word choice and syntax to convey quantified material, how to organize writing reliant on data for both lay and specialized audiences, and how to incorporate data visualization for purposes of understanding and persuasion. There is no need to know anything about statistics; throughout the term we will learn how mathematical encounters with writing can be engaging, exciting, and something we can work on together. We will be going over a handful of statistical concepts in the second half of the course so we can write about them, but the emphasis here will ultimately be on proficiency for the purposes of a given concepts use in writing. By the end of the course, both traditional and quantitative literacy will be improved to serve student development as competent quantitative writers and readers in future PPW courses, courses across different majors at Pitt, in their writing as professionals, and as more discerning consumers and producers of knowledge as global citizens.</div>

            <div class="computerText container font-weight-bold">This course explores the ways that writing supports work in scientific and technical fields. Through a variety of assignments incorporating both written and visual formats, students in this course will learn effective strategies for responding to communication challenges, with special emphasis on audience analysis, document design, communication ethics, collaboration, professional style, and editing. You can expect to develop your ability to organize and craft information for manuals, journal articles, and reports and to learn about document design, production principles, interactive documentation, and desktop publishing. Technical writers are crucial for fields in engineering, software, and the sciences. Successful technical writers are good at translating science and technology for various audiences, including non-experts such as the end users of a product or customers who are willing to pay for technical solutions for a problem. Experts who work in technical and scientific fields can also benefit from familiarity and practice in technical writing.</div>

Drawing on open source ideals and innovation structures, making has become an attempt to democratize material culture through networked access to tools. Makerspaces and makerhubs have become critical nodes in efforts to materialize the virtual gift economy of the internet. In this course we will engage the intellectual and practical roots of this new medial and social form and engage in our own critical making projects, utilizing scanning, modeling, and 3d printing technologies. The course will include examination of the history and philosophy of open source software development and the political, social, cultural, and technological developments that have given rise to critical maker culture. Students will learn some of the basic tools of scanning, modeling, and 3d printing. Throughout, students will reflect on their own work, on the objects around them, and the tools available to them to creatively intervene in that “object ecology.” Its aim is to “close the circuit” between creative conceptual production, social networking, and materialized object relationships. </div>

            <div class="font-weight-bold computerText container">Companies want your attention. You are a consumer of products and services. You represent a prospective employee. You could become a shareholder. So companies reach out to you through advertising, annual reports, blogs, brochures, newsletters, podcasts, promotions, and websites, among other means. And as companies are seeking your attention, they can’t ignore other audiences—current employees, investors, government officials, and the media, for example—who are critical to their success. Companies have plenty to talk about—-their brand, vision, values, new products or services, job openings, employment benefits, financial results, social responsibility efforts—depending on who is listening. In this class, you will examine how companies create their identity through language. You will actively explore five “languages”: employment, marketing, culture, results, and social responsibility. You will study good business writing and apply these techniques in several writing assignments. For example, you will produce a report analyzing the employment brand of two companies where you would like to work after graduation. In a different assignment focused on corporate social responsibility, you will create original communications for a selected company. This course is offered during Fall term. </div>

            <div class="font-weight-bold computerText container">In order to create effective and powerful documents for diverse global audiences, students need to be able to negotiate the expectations, assumptions, conventions, and professional practices of different cultures. This course will help advanced undergraduate students better understand what is at stake in writing for international audiences, how to research issues relating to communication (and especially the use of English) in global contexts, and how to write professional publications for particular international audiences. In this course, students will learn the following: to think critically and to analyze various approaches related to the use of English on a global scale; to shape their writing to account for high- and low-context cultures; to engage with challenges associated with language and translation; to effectively engage with a range of rhetorical moves to persuade a multi-cultural audience; and to account for writing issues like style, tone, clarity, document design, and specialized language in international contexts. This course is offered during Fall term. </div>

            <div class="font-weight-bold computerText container">This course builds upon Composing Digital Media (ENGCMP 0610) by requiring students to compose original projects in a particular focal area digital media while exploring the rhetorical, poetic, and political implications of that focal area. Where students in Composing Digital Media typically learn how to compose a range of critical media objects using web-authoring languages, text, sound, images, and video, Projects in Digital Composition will give students the opportunity to focus closely on a particular theme or category of multimodal composition. As with Composing Digital Media, theories of writing, composing, design, critique, delivery, remediation, and revision are central to the coursework. The course also emphasizes the importance of self-guided skills acquisition. </div>
