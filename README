Our Suggested Pitt Courses for Technical Writer:
Course information comes from the website of English department in the university of Pittsburgh. After thorough study, we pick some representative courses for technical communication purpose.
Images come from the website which can reflect the characteristics of corresponding courses.
In design, the template provides section blocks for each course description. What we do is to edit the blocks and copy block units since we have too many courses. In addition, the size of the blocks is also adjusted to accommodate the large contents.

Editing is simple in this section. We just replace all information with our own.
